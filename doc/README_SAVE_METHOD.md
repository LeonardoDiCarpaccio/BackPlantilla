 # save API method : 

## with save method, we can insert / update complex relations.

###  for exemple to insert a client
###  (we suppose here that client's entity got only one column which is called 'name')

##  so for insert we pass to the /save API this body : 
###  EX : {name : "client 1"}

##  for update, we call the same API but this time we pass the id client to update in the body
###  EX : {id : 1,name : "updated name"}

##  for many to one relations, u can only precise the foreign key OR update both entity in once

###  Exemple with projet entity which is on a ManyToOne relation with client.

###  EX :   @Column()
 ###    clientId : number;

 ###   @ManyToOne(()=>client, client => client.id,{nullable : false,cascade : true, onDelete : "CASCADE"})
###   @JoinColumn({name : "clientId"})


 ## for simple link between project and client, you give this body to save API :

###    {
###      "id" : 1,
###      "clientId" : 2
 ###    }


##  OR u can add a link and edit client in the same time

 ### EX :    
 ### {
 ###        "id": 8,
 ###        "name": "projet1",
 ###        "client": {
 ###            "id" : 3,
 ###            "name" : "client name updated"
###         }
###   }


##   last but not least, u can use save for a mass insert / update

###   for this, send an array as body. rules are the same than before

##  SAVE a MANY TO MANY relation

###  for exemple a user which is on a many to many relation with "role" table: 

###     @ManyToMany(()=>role)
###     @JoinTable()
###     role : role[]


 ##    for insert a user with role id = 1,2 and 3

 ###    EX body :  {
 ###      "name" : "userTest",
###       "role" : [1,2,3]
###   }

 ##  for update same thing with id

###   EX body :   { "id" :1,
###       "name" : "userTest",
###       "role" : [1]
###   }
